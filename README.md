# Motion Alarm System ðŸš¨

A real-time motion detection system built in Arduino (.ino) using:

- PIR motion sensor with hardware interrupt (INT0)
- Pushbutton (INT1) to silence the alarm
- Timer1 configured in CTC mode for periodic UART alerts
- Buzzer and LED as alarm output
- UART communication for logging and remote commands (e.g. `SILENCE`)

## Features

- Hardware-level interrupt handling
- Timer-based periodic UART message (every 4 seconds)
- Remote alarm control via serial input
- Clean and modular code written in **C-style** Arduino

## Run the Project

1. Open `motion_alarm.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Choose Arduino Uno as your board
3. Upload and open Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
4. Simulate motion and try sending the `SILENCE` command!
